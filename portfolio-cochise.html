            <p>During my time as a student at Cochise College I became a work study tutor in order to help students that are struggling in the same way I had been when I was in their place.</p>
            <!--<img src="img/portfolio-details.jpg" alt="">-->
            <p>I helped students in a variety of topics. Mathematics was the most prevalent subject for which students came. I would simplify the problem  and divide it into smaller chunks 
		in order to guide them through the process of solving the problem. This method worked for tutoring College Algebra, trigonometry, Calculus 1, 2, & 3, and Physic with Calculus 1 & 2</p>
            <p>I would also help students with programming. The process was different from math though. If they did not know how to start a programming assignment I would guide them in crafting the 
		pseudo code by asking them how they would do the process in real life and translating that to code.</p>
		<p>If they instead had a problem with their code I would first have to debug their uncommented code and then figure out a way to guide them to the proper conclusion of what was messing up their code and if needed provide aid in comming up with a solution.</p>
		<p>I was also given the job of tutoring spanish students because the Spanish tutor had to leave when the semester was almost over. Since I am fluent Spanish speaker adapting to the new responsibility was easy.</p>
		<p>Other responsibilites I had was in maintaing the student's data private for when they signed in. (I was also given FERPA training for this task.) I also had to keep track of the materials that students would borrow from the tutoring center such as books, calculators, and other school materials.</p>
